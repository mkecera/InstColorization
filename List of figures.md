1. Learning curve with Loss/PSNR/SSIM
   1. default baseline model with several learning rates (Kostas)
   2. Add layers to fusion model weight network (Michal)
   3. Loss function (Qi)
   4. Combination?
2. Example analysis 2-3
3. Sketch for network
4. Frames
5. Sketch of video model
6. Learning curve on video
7. Example analysis with Khalil's test data: with or without context



## Analysis

1. Why change layers
2. Why these type of loss functions
3. Why LAB color space? RGB => LAB 
4. Why two stage models?
